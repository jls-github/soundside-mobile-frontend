# Soundside Mobile Frontend

Soundside Mobile allows Soundside Church to present digital worship guides to its attendees. COVID-19 has changed much of the way people have to "do church." Paper worship guides, connection cards, and handouts increase the amount of contact and possible transmission from person to person. This mobile app solves this problem by putting worship guides onto individual phones via a mobile web app.
